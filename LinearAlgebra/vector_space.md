### 2-D Vector Space

A **2-D** vector-space Is defined as a set of linearly independent basis vectors with 2 axes. Each axis corresponds to a dimension in the vector-space.

Linearly independent vectors of size **N** will result in **N**-dimensional axes which are mutually orthogonal to each other. 

### Vector Space model for Words

Let us assume that all the words in the corpus are considered as _linearly independent basis vectors_; that means, every word is different, they are not connected to any other word. 

Suppose if you are having about 300 words, all 300 words are **independent** and they have no relation to each other(considered as **_linearly independent vectors_**); that means if I do a dot product of word **a** and **b** that result would be going to be **0**. So, again we will be using the notation of v this length of your vocabulary if you consider all of them as linear and then all the vectors related to the words in the vocabulary or linearly independent.
