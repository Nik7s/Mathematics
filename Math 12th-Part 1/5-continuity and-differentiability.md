## RECAP of Derivative and limit

#### Velocity meaning and its formula
The velocity of a moving particle is the distance travelled by it in unit time in a given direction, or in other words, velocity is the **rate of displacement of a body**.


$$\large{\color{Purple}
\boxed{Velocity\ = \frac{displacement}{time \ taken}}
}
$$

#### Types of velocity
* **Uniform velocity**
* **Variable velocity or non-uniform velocity**
* **Average velocity**
Consider a body moving with variable velocity. Then the ratio of total displacement to the total time interval is called average velocity.

$$\large{\color{Purple}
\boxed{Average Velocity\ = \frac{Total\ displacement}{Total\ time \ taken}}
}
$$

* **Instantaneous velocity**
Consider a body moving with variable velocity. The velocity of an object at **a particular instant of time** is called its instantaneous velocity.
For an object in motion along the **X –direction**, let **x(t)** and **x(t + Δt)** be the position co-ordinates at times **t**  and **(t + Δt)** respectively. 

Then its average velocity during the

$$\large{\color{Purple}
\begin{align*}
& v_{avg}\ = \frac{x(t + \Delta t) -x(t)}{(t + \Delta t) -t}\\ 
& v_{avg}\ = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
\end{align*}
}
$$

Then the instantaneous velocity is given by


$$\large{\color{Purple}
\begin{align*}
& v_{inst}\ ,\ \bar{v}= \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \Big\( \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} \Big\)\\
 &\Huge \boxed{v_{inst}\ ,\ \bar{v}= \frac{d x}{d t}} \\
\end{align*}
}
$$

where **Δx** be the displacement of a body in an infinitely **small interval** of time **Δt**.

Here the time **Δt** tends to zero in the limit (because **&Delta;t** is very small that's why **&Delta;t &rarr; 0**). The direction of instantaneous velocity is along the tangent to the path at the point.
Also, $\large \mathbf{\frac{dx}{dt}}$ is the derivative of **x** with respect to time **t**. In other words, the velocity of a particle at any instant is the derivative of the position co-ordinate of the particle with respect to time.

### Continuity Function
**Definition 1:**  Suppose **_f_** is a real function on a subset of the real numbers and let **_c_** be a point in the domain of **_f_**. Then **_f_** is continuous at **c** if

$$\large{\color{Purple}
\boxed{\lim_{x \to c} f(x ) = f(c)}
}
$$
