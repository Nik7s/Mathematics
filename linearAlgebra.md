* Part of math which is used the most in Machine Learning
* Helps in optimization
* Perform operations on the data

### 1. Scalar:

* Scalar, a physical quantity that is completely described by its magnitude; examples of scalars are volume, density, speed, energy, mass, and time.
* Magnetude but no direction is Scalar.
* Other quantities, such as force and velocity, have both magnitude and direction and are called **vectors.**

* Scalars are described by real numbers that are usually but not necessarily positive.
* The work done on a particle by a force, for example, is a negative number when the particle moves in a direction opposite to that in which the force acts.
* Scalars can be manipulated by the ordinary laws of algebra.

### 2. Vector:

* In physics, a quantity that has both magnitude and direction. 
* In Computer Science Vector is a data in tabuler form having rows and columns.
* Vector vs matrix - A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers while a vector is a list of number. Vector have one index matrix having two index.
