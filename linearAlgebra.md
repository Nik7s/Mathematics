* Part of math which is used the most in Machine Learning
* Helps in optimization
* Perform operations on the data

### 1. Scalar:

* Scalar, a physical quantity that is completely described by its magnitude; examples of scalars are volume, density, speed, energy, mass, and time.
* Magnetude but no direction is Scalar.
* Other quantities, such as force and velocity, have both magnitude and direction and are called **vectors.**

* Scalars are described by real numbers that are usually but not necessarily positive.
* The work done on a particle by a force, for example, is a negative number when the particle moves in a direction opposite to that in which the force acts.
* Scalars can be manipulated by the ordinary laws of algebra.

### 2. Vector:

* In physics, a quantity that has both magnitude and direction. 
* In Computer Science Vector is a data in tabuler form having rows and columns.
* Vector vs matrix - A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers while a vector is a list of number. Vector have one index matrix having two index.
### 3. Matrix:

* If <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?A[a_{ji}]_{mXn}" title="A[a_{ji}]_{mXn}" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?B[b_{ji}]_{mXn}" title="B[b_{ji}]_{mXn}" /> are two matrices of the same order then their sum A + B is a matrix, and each element of that matrix is the sum of the corresponding elements. i.e. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?A&plus;B&space;=&space;[a_{ji}&plus;b_{ji}]_{mXn}" title="A+B = [a_{ji}+b_{ji}]_{mXn}" />
* Sum of the two matrix
* <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\begin{vmatrix}a1&space;&&space;b1&space;\\c1&space;&&space;d1&space;\\\end{vmatrix}&space;&plus;\begin{vmatrix}a2&space;&&space;b2&space;\\c2&space;&&space;d2&space;\\\end{vmatrix}&space;=\begin{vmatrix}a1&plus;a2&space;&&space;b1&plus;b2&space;\\c1&plus;c2&space;&&space;d1&plus;d2&space;\\\end{vmatrix}&space;" title="\begin{vmatrix}a1 & b1 \\c1 & d1 \\\end{vmatrix} +\begin{vmatrix}a2 & b2 \\c2 & d2 \\\end{vmatrix} =\begin{vmatrix}a1+a2 & b1+b2 \\c1+c2 & d1+d2 \\\end{vmatrix} " />
#### Properties of Matrix Addition: If A, B and C are matrices of same order, then-
(a) Commutative Law: A + B = B + A

(b) Associative Law:  (A + B) + C = A + (B + C)

(c) Identity of the Matrix: A + O =  O + A = A, where O is zero matrix which is additive identity of the matrix,

(d) Additive Inverse: A + (-A) = 0 = (-A) + A, where (-A) is obtained by changing the sign of every element of A which is additive inverse of the matrix,

(e)      
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\left.\begin{matrix}A&plus;B&space;&&space;=&space;&&space;A&plus;C&space;\\B&plus;A&space;&&space;=&space;&&space;C&plus;A&space;\\\end{matrix}\right\}\Rightarrow&space;B=C" title="\left.\begin{matrix}A+B & = & A+C \\B+A & = & C+A \\\end{matrix}\right\}\Rightarrow B=C" />

(f) <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?tr(A\pm&space;B)=tr(A)\pm&space;tr(B)" title="tr(A\pm B)=tr(A)\pm tr(B)" />

(g) If A + B = 0 = B + A, then B is called additive inverse of A and also A is called the additive inverse of A.
