## Why we need Probability in NLP?
*  Provides methods to predict or make decisions to pick the next word in the sequence based on sampled data
*  Make the informed decision when there a certain degree of uncertainty and some observed data
*  It provides a quantitative description of the chances or likelihoods associated with various outcomes
*  Probability of a sentence
*  Probability of the next word in a sentence - how likely to predict "you" as the next word
*  Likelihood of the next word is formalized through an observation by conducting experiment - counting the words in a document
