* In mathematics and physics, a vector is an element of a vector space.
* Vectors, are objects which have both, magnitude and direction. 
* Magnitude defines the size of the vector. 
* It is represented by a line with an arrow, where the length of the line is the magnitude of the vector and the arrow shows the direction. 
 
* Two vectors are said to equal if their magnitude and direction are the same. 
* A vector can be added to another vector, head to tail. 
* The order of addition of two vectors does not matter, because the result will be the same.

### Vector Notation

* A vector from point "A" to "B" would be like  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\overrightarrow{AB}" title="\overrightarrow{AB}" />

### Magnitude of a Vector

* The magnitude of a vector is shown by vertical lines on both the sides of the given vector “|a|”.
* It represents the length of the vector. Mathematically, the magnitude of a vector is calculated by the help of “Pythagoras Theorem,” i.e.
> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\left|a&space;\right|=\sqrt{(x^2&plus;y^2)}" title="\left|a \right|=\sqrt{(x^2+y^2)}" />

### Unit Vector

* A unit vector has a length (or magnitude) equal to one, which is basically used to show the direction of any vector.
* A unit vector is equal to the ratio of a vector and its magnitude.
* Symbolically, it is represented by a cap or hat (^). 

* If a is vector of arbitrary length and its magnitude is ||a||, then the unit vector is given by:
> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\widehat{a}=\frac{a}{\left\|a&space;\right\|}" title="\widehat{a}=\frac{a}{\left\|a \right\|}" />
* It is also known as normalising a vector.
### Zero Vector

A vector with zero magnitudes is called a zero vector. The coordinates of zero vector are given by (0,0,0) and it is usually represented by 0 with an arrow (→) at the top or just 0.

*  We can do vector operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication on vectors.
